# MushroomPocket

## Description
This is a simple app that allows users to keep track of their mushroom finds. Users can add mushrooms to their collection, view their collection, and delete mushrooms from their collection.

## MushroomKart
Players can choose to play a MushroomKart race game against a computer or in PVP mode against another player.
MushroomPocket uses a proprietary MushroomServer to host PVP games.

If PVP games are not working for you, ensure that you have an `.env.txt` file in the root directory with the following contents:
```
ServerAPIKey=mushprodKey2024
GameServerAddress=https://mushroomserver.prakhar.app
```
